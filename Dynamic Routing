Dynamic routing:
It uses a routing protocol for creating a route for the data packets. 
Here the router automatically collect and store the dynamic route in the routing table.
The administrator is not going to create a route for the data packet instead the network administrator will assign a routing protocol to all of these routers
and this protocol will decide the best route for these data packets. 
If any of the routers or links fail to work then the routing protocol is smart enough to find another alternative route.
it minimizes the work pressure of the network administrator.
And the users do not need to wait for long time for the link to go up.
Dynamic routing makes the use of protocols like RIP, IGRP, EIGRP, OSPF, IS-IS
